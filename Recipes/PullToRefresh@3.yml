// Pull to Refresh is natively supported in SwiftUI 3. The (1-2) version is still arguably more powerful.
@State private var now = Date() 

List(1..<20) { row in
    Text("\(Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .hour, value: $0, to: now)!)")
        .padding(.bottom, 10)
}
.refreshable {
    now = Date()
}
